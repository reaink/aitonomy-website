### **Privacy Technology Practices**

**Links to Third-Party Sites**

The AItonomy.world Platform may contain links to external websites, mobile applications, or online services operated by third parties. These links do not signify our endorsement or affiliation with these third parties. Additionally, our content may appear on websites or services not controlled by us. We do not oversee these third-party platforms and are not responsible for their practices. Each platform has its own policies regarding the collection, use, and sharing of personal data. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.

**Data Security**

Protecting your personal data is important to us. We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to secure the personal data we collect. However, the security of information transmitted over the internet also depends on you. We advise against sharing your personal security information with others.
